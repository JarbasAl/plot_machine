Classification 

NOTE 

A mere reading of this list of characters in their various combinations is in it- 
self highly suggestive to the trained imagination. Certain combinations will have 
their appeal and, by their reference numbers, may be immediately referred to in the 
various Conflict Groups. 

The use for which this list is designed, however, primarily covers the selection 
of terminal Conflicts. _ The C Clauses of the Masterplots are numbered in parentheses; 
and, in the Classification by Character Symbols, the terminal suggestions are all group- 
ed with their corresponding numbers at the end of each sub-group of Conflicts. If 
the number of the desired terminal Conflict is not found in the sub-group, other sub- 
groups should be scanned for a Conflict approximating the one desired, and the situa- 
tion altered to correspond with the needs of the moment. Or, another terminal Clause 
may be almost synonomous with the one required, and its number substituted. 

Very often, in writing a story a knotty point will be reached where the ingenuity 
of the writer wavers, or where he wishes to give the action a different trend. A study 
of the Classification by Symbols will be found rich in suggestions of means for meeting 
such an emergency. Such a study may be best approached in this manner: 
Resolve the leading characters of your story's situation into Plotto character 
symbols; if possible, not more than two or three symbols. Then look up the C9mbina- 
tion of symbols in the foregoing index and follow the references to the Classification 
by Symbols and, if necessary, on into the Conflicts. 

If desired combinations of symbols cannot be found, a single symbol of the de- 
sired combination may be changed into the Plotto utility symbol, A-8 or B-8, or any 
other symbol which nearest approximates the one desired. Here, as elsewhere in 
Plotto, transposition, change and manipulation will bring the utmost in results.
