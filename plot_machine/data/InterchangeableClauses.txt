A Plotto Masterplot consists of three clauses: An "A" Clause, a "B" Clause and a "C" Clause. 

The A Clause is the Protagonist Clause. 
The B Clause originates and carries on the action. 
The C Clause carries on and terminates the action. 

Any A Clause may be used in conjunction with any B Clause and with any C Clause. For the purpose of bringing all the B Clauses in juxtaposition with all the A and C Clauses, it is merely necessary to turn the narrow page. 

Suggestions for evolving a plot to the pattern of the Masterplot selected will be found in the Plotto Conflicts. The Conflicts are listed in sub-groups; and each sub-group is listed under the full text of the B Clause which the sub-group exemplifies. 

On the page immediately following the Masterplot pages will be found an index of the respective Conflict sub-groups under the parentheses number of the B Clause. 

The C, or Terminal, Clauses are also numbered in parentheses; and Conflicts suggesting these terminations will be found opposite the C Clause numbers in the Classification by Symbols.
