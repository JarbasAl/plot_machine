The Soul, with its human faculties which put it in 
immediate touch with the Universe, is a Divine In- 
strument, an Aeolian Harp which is not played upon 
by the Winds of Chance but by all the Winds of Des- 
tiny that blow from the four quarters of Human 
Nature; and this Music of the Soul is a Divine 
Harmony which the Creative Imagination, alone 
of the human faculties, interprets in Creative Art. 
To this high interpretation, through fictional narrative.

INTRODUCTION 

THE PLOTTO METHOD. Plotto achieves creative art in fiction by a new 
Method of plot suggestion. Suggestion is based on Themes (or Masterplots) 
and Conflicts. 

THEME. Every story has a Theme, or an underlying proposition that indi- 
cates its type. The Theme may be clear-cut and distinct, or shadowy and vague; 
it is always in evidence, and differentiates one type of story from all the other 
types. Around each Theme any number of distinctly different stories may be 
written. 

A story may be constructed with, or without, a certain Theme in mind. Rarely 
perhaps does a writer begin a story with a set Theme in front of him. He may 
develop his plot from a situation, or Conflict; nevertheless, as the plot develops the 
Theme develops with it. The writer will feel the Theme and, consciously or un- 
consciously, combine his Conflicts to a certain pattern. This pattern, plain in the 
finished work, will conform to a Theme. When a story is built around a Theme, 
the Theme becomes a Masterplot. 

The Plotto Method enables the Plottoist to begin his story with a Masterplot 
and marshal his situations or Conflicts in conformity to it; or, it enables him to 
begin with a situation or Conflict and consciously to watch the particular Theme 
as the plot unfolds. 

MASTERPLOTS WITH INTERCHANGEABLE CLAUSES. Each Plotto 
Masterplot classifies in general terms and in a single terse sentence a certain type 
of story. Each Masterplot consists of three Clauses: An initial Clause defining the 
protagonist in general terms, a middle Clause initiating and carrying on the action, 
and a final Clause carrying on and terminating the action. Suggestions for ex- 
emplifying the action with concrete situations are offered by the Conflicts. 

THE CONFLICTS. Desire, in some one of its many forms, is responsible for 
the awakening of Purpose. Something from without, impinging upon something 
within, excites a feeling or an emotion, and the soul flows into Purpose, and Purpose 
into action. Then, somewhere on the path of rising action. Purpose encounters 
Obstacle. At this point, and at this point only, do we establish what writers of 
creative fiction call a situation. Purpose alone never made a situation; Obstacle 
alone never made one; but strike the flint of Obstacle with the steel of Purpose and 
sparks of situation begin to fly. 

Plotto, as a Method of plot suggestion for writers of creative fiction, is found- 
ed upon this law: Purpose, expressed or implied, opposing Obstacle, ex- 
pressed or implied, yields Conflict. 

PURPOSES AND OBSTACLES, How many Purposes are there in the world? 

Not many, although their variations are infinite. Perhaps, in the last analysis 
one General Purpose would comprehend all the Purposes: TO ACHIEVE HAP- 
PINESS. That is the end and aim of life on this planet. But happiness has a 
different meaning for most of us. There is the happiness of love and courtship, 
of married life, of achieving wealth or power by all the many methods, good or evil, 
that may be contrived by the thinking mind. Religion may be the road to happiness 



for some, and revenge the road to a doubtful happiness for others. The virtues or 
the faults of a human soul set the pattern of Purpose for that soul. 

Plotto concerns itself with but one General Purpose in its application to three 
general goals of endeavor: 

1. To Achieve Happiness in Love and Courtship. 

2. To Achieve Happiness in Married Life. 

3. To Achieve Happiness (Success) in Enterprise. 

Yet, while this one General Purpose runs through all the Conflicts, a host of 
subordinate Purposes will appear in them, opposed by an infinite number of Ob- 
stacles. 

There is one Supreme Purpose in every life: TO LIVE; and there is one Su- 
preme Obstacle each life encounters: DEATH. Complicating the scheme and 
giving zest to the plot of life are innumerable subordinate Purposes and Obstacles, 
dealing with all the enterprises of which life is capable. 

Overshadowed by the Supieme Purpose of LIFE, and the Supreme Obstacle 
of DEATH, we wage our mimic wars of conquest and gain; but, at any minute, 
the Supreme Purpose may fail, and Death come striding into our finite calculations 
and calling a truce. There is also a Paramount Purpose in all the lesser activities 
of our existence, opposed by a Paramount Obstacle; and they marshal their secon- 
dary Purposes and Obstacles to keep us "on our toes" and fighting valiantly for 
all we have, or hope to have. Blessed be Purpose! And thrice-blessed be Obsta- 
cle! 

The Conflicts in Plotto are brief statements of Purpose in active opposition with 
Obstacle — situations which are to be combined with other situations. For in- 
stance: "A, in love with B, is not favored by F-B, father of B." Here is the 
implied Purpose, "To Achieve Happiness in Love," meeting an Obstacle bluntly 
expressed. 

Purpose and Obstacle give concrete exemplification of the Theme in every 
form of fictional narrative, whether short story, novelette, or novel. 

THE SHORT STORY. Purpose and Obstacle at grips in one dramatic situ- 
ation will define the short story, since it is calculated to leave a single dominant im- 
pression upon the reader's mind. Ordinarily, this form of narrative fiction will be 
woven about a plot of the simplest construction. There will be the main situation 
as suggested by a chosen Conflict, the Conflict leading up to it and the Conflict 
carrying on and terminating the action. These three Conflicts may be reduced to 
two, if the main Conflict should in itself possess the qualities of a terminal Con- 
flict. Conflicts too long, or too involved, for short story purposes will usually be 
found to be broken Conflicts. When such a Conflict is selected for the main situa- 
tion, it '<: possible to use only that part of it which contains the most dramatic ap- 
peal. 

THE NOVELETTE. This form of narrative fiction may be considered as a 
long short story, or as a short novel. If the former, the Conflict suggesting the 
situation will be elaborated with dramatic material concerned with the Purpose 
and Obstacle. If, on the other hand, the novelette partakes of the character of 
a short novel, the Paramount Purpose and Obstacle will involve subordinate Pur- 
poses and Obstacles all cumulative in power and bearing upon the story's climax 
or crisis. Here, as everywhere, the imagination must exercise constructive judg- 
ment. 



THE NOVEL. The full-fledged novel may be considered as consisting of 
several short stories all leading up to, and intimately bound up with, the Paramount 
Purpose and Obstacle that give the complete story its unity. Construction here 
plays its most discriminating role, for the subordinate situations must grow toward 
a single, decisive crisis. The effect must be cumulative. If the main Conflict 
shall involve the crisis — and it should — all the subordinate situations dealing with 
the Theme will be so selected as to grow naturally in dramatic strength toward the 
climax. Here no rules of construction will take the place of taste and discrimina- 
tion. The constructive imagination, properly exercised, will deal capably with 
the situations, and the creative imagination will work a miracle of dramaturgic 
power. 

ORIGINALITY. The Conflicts all come from the vast storehouse of Human 
Nature. They are there, millions upon millions of them, waiting for the imagina- 
tion to select them and groUp them in an original combination. For there is "noth- 
ing new under the sun." Originality in creative work comes from our own in- 
dividual use of the tools so bountifully provided by the Divine Creator. All that 
is possible to a mortal craftsman is the combining of old material into something 
new and different. 

Originality is the ideal of the Plotto Method; and it is realized by disregarding 
the references prefixed and affixed to the Conflicts and (or) interpreting the Specific 
as well as the General, Conflicts in terms of the Plottoist's own experience. Noth- 
ing in the Specific Conflicts will be used literally, but the concrete exemplification 
in such Conflicts will serve as a suggestion, lending wings to the creative imagina- 
tion for its own high flight. 

For orginal combinations of Conflicts the Classification by Symbols will be 
found a treasure-trove of suggestions. If the main Conflict selected is built around 
A, or B, alone, the A or B group should be scanned; if around A and B alone, the 
A and B group will yield suggestions, or the A or B group may be found to serve; 
or, if several characters are involved in the main Conflict, reference may be had to 
that particular group of symbols. If a certain group of symbols proves too limited, 
drop one of the lesser character symbols and consult the group represented by those 
remaining. This course may be followed, in the search for original combinations, 
until only the protagonist remains in the situation. Somewhere along the line of 
search the imagination is certain to find exactly what it is looking for. 

CONFLICT GROUPS AND SUB-GROUPS. The Conflicts in Plotto are 
classified in three main groups: 

1. Conflicts in Love and Courtship. 

2. Conflicts in Married Life. 

3. Conflicts in Enterprise. 

The Conflicts in Love and Courtship are re-grouped as follows: 

Conflicts in Love's Beginnings. 

Conflicts in Love's Misadventures. 

Conflicts of the Marriage Proposal. 

Conflicts in Love's Rejection. 

Conflicts of Marriage. 

All the sub-groups are classified, for convenience of reference, under the middle. 
or "B," Clauses of the Masterplots; and these form the only subdivisions of the 



main group, "Married Life." Conflicts of the third group. "Enterprise." fall into 
the following general classifications: 

Conflicts in Misfortune. 

Conflicts in Mistaken Judgment. 

Conflicts in Helpfulness. 

Conflicts in Deliverance. 

Conflicts in Idealism. 

Conflicts in Obligation. 

Conflicts in Necessity. 

Conflicts in Chance. 

Conflicts in Personal Limitations. 

Conflicts in Simulation. 

Conflicts in Craftiness. 

Conflicts in Transgression. 

Conflicts in Revenge. 

Conflicts in Mystery. 

Conflicts in Revelation. 

Inasmuch as dramatic situations are a product of the emotions, and the emo- 
tions, by reason of their complexity, have defied a hard and fast classification, it 
follows naturally that the Conflicts themselves will defy a rigid classification. The 
groupings noted above are more or less arbitrary, yet they will be bound to serve. 
Some Conflicts in Misfortune might easily fall into the sub-groups, Mistaken Judg- 
ment, Simulation, etc., and Conflicts in other sub-groups might logically be re- 
classified. Nevertheless, the classification in each case will exemplify in the Con- 
flict the particular sub-group in which it has been placed. 

MECHANICAL STRUCTURE. There is, of course, a mechanical structure 
underlying every properly constructed story. There are some very intelligent 
people who believe in the "divine afflatus" as something apart from hard, consistent, 
carefully calculated effort. Overlooking the old adage that "Genius is an infinite 
capacity for taking pains," these wise ones will have their back-handed slap at 
anything mechanical in its application to Art. 

It remains, however, that a good story must have a carefully developed plot for 
its framework; and the plot in itself, is purely mechanical. It is the logical devising 
of means to an end, a motivating of all the parts into a harmonious whole. A plot 
may be simple, or it may be complex, but an interesting story without some sort 
of plot is inconceivable. This machinery must not creak or complain as the story 
advances. A discriminating imagination must oil it so well with logic and plausi- 
bility that the god in the machine shall not be ruffled by the turning wheels. Plausi- 
bility is attained when fine discrimination, true judgment and a facility with words 
so cover the necessary mechanism that it does not intrude at any point upon the 
completed work. And therein lies the art of the story teller. Plotto, at least, 
holds this to be true; and, as a corollary of the position thus taken, exalts the im- 
agination as the greatest force in the world. 

IMAGINATION. If a story is a skeleton structure of plot, overlaid with a 
felicity of thought and phrase that may be called the flesh, then the pulsing heart 
of the creation, the one factor that gives it life and beauty, is the imagination. But 
this imagination must be rightly controlled. 

The demands of fictional narrative would seem to predicate an imagination of 
three types: Mediocre, Constructive and Creative. A mind positively brilliant 
in its mastery of scientific research, or of the pursuit of trade, might be hopless in 



meeting the demands of fictional narrative. Nevertheless, Plotto believes sincerely 
that a desire to write successful fiction is predicated upon the ability to write 
successful fiction; and that, given the technical requirements of experience and a 
fair education, not often will the mediocre imagination be found hopeless. In- 
tensive training should develop constructive power; and it is but a step, in the in- 
terpretation of suggestion, from the constructive to the creative. Originality is 
the soul of creative art, and originality is nothing more than the interpretation of 
suggestion in terms of individual experience. 

Each life is the sum of many experiences, and character indicates the reaction 
of those experiences upon the soul. In other words, life is a combination of situa- 
tions, or Conflicts, with a spiritual signification drawn from the Conflicts them- 
selves. So a story plot, which holds the mirror up to life, is a combination of Con- 
flicts, selected to the pattern of a single Theme, or Masterplot. Life, with 
its multitude of experiences, is general; the imagination, dealing with a cross-section 
of life, makes the story plot particular. And imagination does this through the 
interpretation of suggestion. 

SUGGESTION. The ideal of the Plotto Method, as stated elsewhere, is the 
interpretation of Conflict suggestions in terms of individual experience. Some of 
the Conflicts are General. Thus, Conflict No. 31 reads: "B. rescued from an 
accident by A, whom she does not know, falls in love with him." The nature of 
the accident, and the character of B and of A, are circumstances left to the con- 
structive imagination. In dealing with these circumstances, references to other 
Conflicts, prefixed and affixed to this general suggestion, will offer further sugges- 
tions for inventing the circumstances. 

Many of the Conflicts are Specific. Thus, to quote Conflict No. 647: "B, a 
respectable working girl seeking employment, follows the advice of a supposed 
friend. A-5, and finds herself in an immoral dance hall where she is compelled to 
dance with patrons and serve drinks." References to other Conflicts will suggest 
the cause of B's necessity for seeking employment, and other references will suggest 
a finale for B's unhappy plight. The constructive imagination might use Conflict 
No. 647 literally, but Plotto would not approve of such literal use. The ideal 
method is for the imagination to use the dance hall merely as a suggestion for some- 
thing equally pertinent to the situation; in other words, use the concrete example 
in interpreting an equivalent for this specific suggestion as to B's misfortune. 
Herein lies the opportunity for originality, and the way to creative work. 

DEVELOPING THE PLOT FROM A MASTERPLOT. For purposes of illus- 
tration, we will select a Masterplot from the Masterplot Chart and build up a 
short story plot in tabloid form. 

All A Person Swayed by Pretense, 

B 11 (49) Assuming a fictitious character when embarking upon a certain 
enterprise, 

C 2 Emerges happily from a serious entanglement. 

The B Clause "originates and carries on the action." Prefixed to this B Clause 
in parentheses is the number, (49). On the back of the Masterplot Chart, we find 
that No. (49) refers us to a sub-group of Conflicts beginning with Conflict No. 1173, 
this particular B Clause serving as a title for the sub-group: 

1173 

(2b. c, d, e, g, h) (1187; 2f) 

A, a pretender, encounters B, who is also a pretender * A and B are pretenders, 



yet neither knov/s the other is not what he or she seems to be ** (773; 772 ch A to 
B & A-4 to A) (806 ch B-4 to B) (1462) 

The reference numbers prefixed to this Conflict offer lead-up suggestions. 
Numbers 1187 and 2f form a complementary suggestion, or a combination of two 
Conflicts appropriate to the main situation. 

1187. A is a poor clerk who, with a limited capital, dons a dress suit and takes 
a "fling" in high society. 

2f *.**. B, poor and humble but pretending to be wealthy and aristocratic, meets 
rich and influential A, and they fall in love. 

Thus we have our two pretenders, neither knowing that the other is not what 
he or she seems to be. No. 2f has a carry-on suggestion: 

1461a. B fights a hard battle with her conscience; she finds it a losing battle 
and makes an important revelation in order that she may achieve peace of mind. 

A and not B is the protagonist of 1461a, but we manipulate the Conflict by 
changing A to B. This Conflict has a reference, No. 358 **.***; 
358 **-***. A, in order to win B, is compelled to confess his true rank and station. 

We can now eliminate our main suggestion. Conflict 1173, so that our tabloid 
plot will reaa: 

2f *.**, B^ poor and humble but pretending to be wealthy and aristocratic, meets 
rich and influential A, and they fall in love. 

1187. A is a poor clerk who, with a limited capital, dons a dress suit and takes a 
"fling" in high society. 

1461a. B fights a hard battle with her conscience; she finds it a losing battle, and 
makes an important revelation in order that she may achieve peace of mind. 
358 **-***. A, in order to win B, is compelled to confess his true rank and station. 

We have manipiilated the combination Conflict by allowing 2f *-** to precede 
1187; and if we keep the reader in ignorance of the fact that A and B are pretenders 
and allow the revelation to come at the end of the story, we shall achieve a double 
surprise and find ourselves with the plot of O. Henry's story, "Transients in Ar- 
cadia." Yet any number of stories, true to the Masterplot, may be built around 
these suggestions. 

By changing the first two situations and selecting different Conflicts, the plot 
will develop along criminal lines: 

2h. B, a criminal, assumes an alias and makes use of stolen funds in evading the 
the law * B, a criminal in disguise, meets A, and they fall in love ** 
Ic. A, a crook, pretends to be an honest man in order to forward his love affair 
with B. 

Or, we could make our plot more dramatic by having the second situation read: 
3a. A is a judge, and B is a fugitive from justice posing as a woman of wealth and 
fashion * A, a judge, falls in love with B, a criminal ** 

This might be followed with: 
1292. B seeks happiness as a reform.ed transgressor * B, seeking happiness as a 
reformed transgressor, has her old transgression discovered ** 

727. A, a judge presiding at a murder trial, finds himself unexpectedly confronted 
with a circumstance that makes his work a torture to his soul. 



These changes in the plot would make necessary a change in the C clause of 
the Masterplot: 

C (1). Pays a grim penalty in an unfortunate undertaking. 

CONFLICT MANIPULATIONS. Characters in the Plotto Conflicts are 
represented by symbols (see "The Plotto Character Symbols," page 17). These 
symbols may be readily changed or transposed, as an aid in manipulating the Con- 
flict suggestions. Thus, "261 ch A-3 to A," indicates that A-3 in the Conflict is 
to be changed to A; and, "57Sb tr B & B-3," indicates a transposition in which 
B-3 takes the place of B and B of B-3. 

The character symbols are changed, or transposed, in the auxiliary Conflicts 
to agree with the character symbols of the Conflict whose ramifications are being 
studied. 

In many instances the Conflicts are "broken" — that is, divided into two or 
more parts. The end of the first part is marked with a star (*), of the second part, 
with a double star (**), of the third part with a triple star (***), etc. Thus,"-*" 
indicates that the Conflict is to be used up to the first star; "*.**" indicates that 
the first part of the Conflict is not to be used, but only that part between the first 
star and the double star; ".**" indicates that all of the Conflict is to be used up 
to the double star, etc. 

DEVELOPING THE PLOT FROM A SELECTED SITUATION. The 

most practical way to illustrate the Plotto Method of developing a plot from a 
single situation, or Conflict, will be to select a Conflict and follow the Method 
through, step by step. For this purpose, the first Conflict, la, may be used: 

1 

(a) (112) (117) (148) (656) 

A, poor, is in love with wealthy and aristocratic B * A, poor, in love with wealthy 

B, pretends to be a man of wealth ** (209) (187) 

The simplest combination will consist of three Conflicts — the Conflict selected 
as the working basis for the plot, the one Conflict leading up to it, and the third 
Conflict terminating the action, both auxiliary Conflicts taken from the references 
prefixed and affixed to the main, or basic, situation. For example, as a lead-up 
Conflict No. 112 may be used, followed by la, and this in turn followed by No. 209. 

It develops, however, that the second part of the broken Conflict, la, may be 
eliminated; and that, with this elimination, la -* may logically precede Conflict 112, 
giving the three-Conflict plot as follows: 

la -*. A, POOR, IS IN LOVE WITH WEALTHY AND ARISTOCRATIC B. 
112. A loves B; and B's father, F-B, promises him B's hand in marriage if he will 
successfully carry out an enterprise of great difficulty and danger. 
209. A carries out successfully a very difficult enterprise when promised the hand 
of B in marriage by F-B, father of B * A, discovering secretly that B loves a rival, 
A-3, refuses to hold B to a promise of marriage made by her father, F-B ** 

Nobility of character on the part of A is suggested by this heroic renunciation. 
The character of B, of F-B and of A-3, as well as the "enterprise of great difficulty 
and danger," may be left to the creative imagination. 

Again using Conflict la for our main suggestion, we might begin with Conflict 
656 for a lead-up: 



656 

(751) (961) (1000) (1079) 

A's ancestral acres have been heavily mortgaged and he is about to lose the prop- 
erty * A, by hook or crook, seeks to save his mortgaged paternal acres from fore- 
closure ** (500) (860) (874) (1029) 

Reaching backward into the causes of A's unfortunate condition, we will select 
lead-up sugge.stion No. 1079. Many other Conflicts in Personal Limitations, 
Misfortune, or. some of the other groups would serve us equally well, or better; 
but we will content ourselves with 

1079 
(127a) (656) 

A's character weakness is betting; * and he seems unable to conquer the failing 
although he invariably suffers loss ** (367a) (524a) (902) 

Here we have a suggestion as to the character weakness which caused A to 
squander his fortune and mortgage his ancestral estates. We shall assume now 
that none of the references prefixed or affixed to 1079 appeals to our imagination, 
so we shall proceed on our own initiative — a course which Plotto earnestly recom- 
mends to the Plottoist in the working out of every plot. A further study of i.'er- 
sonal Limitations suggests 

1075 
(a) (850b) (902) 

A, struggling hopelessly against a character weakness, forms a platonic friendship 
for B (838 ch A to B & A-2 to A) (850a, b) (364d) (1075b) 

Thus we have A, struggling hopelessly against a character weakness that has 
wrecked him financially, forming a platonic friendship for B. If we consider it 
expedient to bring about a dramatic first meeting of A with B, the Conflicts are 
brimming with such suggestions. But we will not go into that in this skeleton 
plot, our object being to simplify the references as much as possible. Conflict 
1075b, a reference appended to 1075a, offers this suggestion as to B's influence 
over A: "A's admiration for his friend B, and his desire to please her, inspires him 
to bring out the best in his nature." Also appended to 1075a is a reference to 
Conflict 364d, which seems quite apropos at this point: 

364 

(d) (850a, b) (1075a, b) 

A, with the help of B, overcomes an ignoble weakness * A's gratitude to B blossoms 
into love; and, when A is sure he has rehabilitated his character, he proposes mar- 
riage to B and is accepted ** (826) (828) 

This Conflict may be called a terminal Conflict, in the sense that it brings our 
love story plot to marriage, the finale of most such plots. But we are not ready, 
as yet, to close the action, inasmuch as we are merely leading up to the main situa- 
tion, la; so we shall use only the first part of this broken Conflict: "A, with the 
help of B, overcomes an ignoble weakness." 

At last we have the female protagonist, B, firmly fixed in the plot, and we need 
not go back further into the lead-ups. 

1079. A's character weakness is betting, and he seems unable to conquer the 
failing although he invariably suffers loss. 

656. A's ancestral estates have been heavily mortgaged and he is about to lose 
the property * A, by hook or crook, seeks to save his paternal acres from fore- 
closure ** 



1075a. A, struggling hopelessly against a character weakness, forms a platonic 

friendship for B. 

1075b. A's admiration for his friend B, and his desire to please her, inspires him 

to bring out the best in his nature. 

364d -*. A, with the help of B, overcomes an ignoble weakness. 

la. A. POOR. IS IN LOVE WITH WEALTHY AND ARISTOCRATIC B * A. 

POOR. IN LOVE WITH WEALTHY B. PRETENDS TO BE A MAN OF 

WEALTH ** 

From this, it is manifest that A's platonic association with B has gone the way 
of most platonic associations (see Conflicts 9a, b, c). and his gratitude has blos- 
somed into love. A, by inference, is so deeply in love with B that the best in his 
nature is. for the time, eclipsed by his desire to win B. He resorts to simulation 
in forwarding his suit — thinking less of saving his ancestral acres by a wealthy 
marriage than he is of his own future happiness. Conflict la has a reference to 
Conflict 187 for carrying on the action: 

187 

(145) (956-*) (1105) (1119) 

A, in love with B and wishing to propose marriage, finds it impossible because B 
is so busy he can never find her alone. He seeks to make an opportunity by strat- 
agem. (163; 91) (352a) 

We will discard this suggestion, for the reason that it will plunge A deeper into 
the questionable methods into which his ardor has already lured him. He is pre- 
tending to be a man of wealth when he is almost a bankrupt; but he has overcome 
his passion for gambling, thanks to B's influence, and he is ready to husband his 
remaining resources and save what he can from the wreck of his material fortunes. 
A carry-on suggestion appended to Conflict 187 is a two-Conflict combination, 
163; 91: 

163. B learns that her lover. A, has fallen into desperate misfortunes. 
91. B, in love with A. seeks to save A from disaster. 

We are now approaching the climax of the action. A's pretensions to wealth, 
B secretly discovers, are a hollow mockery. She learns that he is faced with dis- 
aster; and the Conflicts, if desired, will offer suggestions as to just how she discovers 
this secret. B is in love with A and ready to overlook his shortcomings, so she 
hastens to his rescue. We will depart, at this point, from the references and show 

B. on her own part, indulging in a bit of simulation. Turning to the sub-group. 
Simulation, we select Conflict, 

1155 

B, the friend of A. learns that A is desperately involved in debt * B, unknown to A. 
settles with A's creditors and frees him from debt ** 

This happy turn of affairs, naturally, cannot long remain unknown to A. If he 
has pride, let him pocket it; or let his pride be humbled by B's proof of her great 
love for him. If this course cannot be made to serve, the Conflicts will offer many 
suggestions for estrangement and reconciliation; but, in our plot, we will not have 
A a cad. Of the thousands of changes possible in such a series of actions as we are 
studying, we could eliminate the Conflicts from 163. inclusive, onward and place 
A in a better light by using this suggestion from Revelation: 

1451a. A fights a hard battle with his conscience; he finds it a losing battle, and 
makes an important revelation in order that he may achieve peace of mind. 



10 



But we will not make the change. We will proceed to close the action with 
Conflict 364d *-**: "A's gratitude to B blossoms into love; and when A is sure he 
has rehabilitated his character, he proposes to B and is accepted." 

The nature of the Conflicts, and their pliability, often calls for useless repetition. 
The statement in 364d that "A's gratitude to B has blossomed into love," is redun- 
dant. That fact has been known for some time, and has formed the basis for much 
of the action; and we simply ignore it here. 

The latter part of this love story plot would stand as follows: 

la. A, POOR, IN LOVE WITH WEALTHY AND ARISTOCRATIC B, PRE- 
TENDS TO BE A MAN OF WEALTH. 

163. B learns that her lover. A, has fallen into desperate misfortunes. 
91. B, in love with A, seeks to save A from disaster. 

1155. B, in love with A, learns that A is desperately involved in debt * B un- 
known to A, settles with A's creditors and frees him from debt ** 

364d *-**. A's gratitude to B blossoms into love; and when A is sure he has re- 
habilitated his character, he proposes to B and is accepted. 

In the Classification by Character Symbols, all terminal Conflicts are marked 
by the parentheses number of the C Clauses. For instance, 364d exemplifies C 
Clause (9), "Achieves success and happiness in a hard undertaking." This Con- 
flict, 364d, will be found, marked "9", under the A and B symbols of Conflicts in 
Marriage in the Classification by Symbols. An elusive terminal situation may be 
run down by consulting this Classification. 



INDIVIDUALIZING PLOTTO. It is possible for the Plottoist to indivi- 
dualize his Plotto by adding material of his own. Every writer has newspaper 
clippings or other memoranda filed away for possible use. Let all this be catalogued 
in a loose-leaf book under the Conflict numbers to which each bit of material applies, 
and a notation to that effect penciled opposite the Conflicts thus amplified. This 
will broaden the usefulness of Plotto, often with concrete exemplifications of the 
Conflicts from real life.

Masterplots with Interchangeable Clauses 



NOTE 



A Plotto Masterplot consists of three clauses: An "A" Clause, 
a "B" Clause and a "C" Clause. 

The A Clause is the Protagonist Clause. 

The B Clause originates and carries on the action. 

The C Clause carries on and terminates the action. 

Any A Clause may be used in conjunction with any B Clause 
and with any C Clause. For the purpose of bringing all the B 
Clauses in juxtaposition with all the A and C Clauses, it is merely 
necessary to turn the narrow page. 

Suggestions for evolving a plot to the pattern of the Masterplot 
selected will be found in the Plotto Conflicts. The Conflicts are 
listed in sub-groups; and each sub-group is listed under the full 
text of the B Clause which the sub-group exemplifies. 

On the page immediately following the Masterplot pages will 
be found an index of the respective Conflict sub-groups under the 
parentheses number of the B Clause. 

The C, or Terminal, Clauses are also numbered in parentheses; 
and Conflicts suggesting these terminations will be found opposite 
the C Clause numbers in the Classification by Symbols.

THE PLOTTO CHARACTER SYMBOLS 

Characters in the Plotto Conflicts are represented by symbols. These symbols 
indicate the relationship of the auxiliary characters to the protagonist. This rela- 
tionship is invariably explained in the text of the Conflicts, with the exception of 
the symbols A and B — these being the symbols of the male, and the female, pro- 
tagonists. These symbols give a certain uniformity to the characters and facilitate 
character changes or transpositions. Protagonist A, or B, might be a criminal, an 
ofiRcer of the law, an employer, etc., but the numeral is never used in connection with 
the protagonist symbol — the explanation is given in the text.

CN-B may on occasion be merely BR, SR, SN. D. and CN. 

Where necessary to indicate a male friend of B. or a female friend of A, 
the symbols aB-2, bA-2 may be used. Likewise, bCN-A, female cousin 
of A; aCN-B, male cousin of B, bGCH-A, female grandchild of A, aCH.

NOTE 

A mere reading of this list of characters in their various combinations is in it- 
self highly suggestive to the trained imagination. Certain combinations will have 
their appeal and, by their reference numbers, may be immediately referred to in the 
various Conflict Groups. 

The use for which this list is designed, however, primarily covers the selection 
of terminal Conflicts. _ The C Clauses of the Masterplots are numbered in parentheses; 
and, in the Classification by Character Symbols, the terminal suggestions are all group- 
ed with their corresponding numbers at the end of each sub-group of Conflicts. If 
the number of the desired terminal Conflict is not found in the sub-group, other sub- 
groups should be scanned for a Conflict approximating the one desired, and the situa- 
tion altered to correspond with the needs of the moment. Or, another terminal Clause 
may be almost synonomous with the one required, and its number substituted. 

Very often, in writing a story a knotty point will be reached where the ingenuity 
of the writer wavers, or where he wishes to give the action a different trend. A study 
of the Classification by Symbols will be found rich in suggestions of means for meeting 
such an emergency. Such a study may be best approached in this manner: 
Resolve the leading characters of your story's situation into Plotto character 
symbols; if possible, not more than two or three symbols. Then look up the C9mbina- 
tion of symbols in the foregoing index and follow the references to the Classification 
by Symbols and, if necessary, on into the Conflicts. 

If desired combinations of symbols cannot be found, a single symbol of the de- 
sired combination may be changed into the Plotto utility symbol, A-8 or B-8, or any 
other symbol which nearest approximates the one desired. Here, as elsewhere in 
Plotto, transposition, change and manipulation will bring the utmost in results.
